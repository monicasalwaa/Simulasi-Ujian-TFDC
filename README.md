# Simulasi Ujian TensorFlow Developer Certificate 

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam simulation contains 3 machine learning question packages with different datasets for each package. Each pack contains 5 problems that must be solved. In the process of working on it, I used Python 3.9 which was operated on the PyCharm IDE.  Of these 5 problems, I have to solve them as follows:

1. Created and traind an artificial neural network model using TensorFlow 2.x.
2. Created a model for image classification with the CNN model
3. Used artificial neural networks to solve NLP problems using TensorFlow.
4. Solved time series, sequence, and predictions problems using TensorFlow
